# incompressible-two-phase-flow-solver
We discretize the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard equations system on a collocated grid by finite volume method, and the convective term is discretized in high-precision WENO scheme. The program enables to capture large interfacial topology changes of two-phase flow accurately.

Usage: Open with matlab, switch to the downloaded folder, and run main.m
